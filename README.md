## Merging Codex branches

To incorporate updates generated by Codex, run the merge helper script:

```bash
scripts/merge-codex-branches.sh [target-branch]
```

The optional `target-branch` defaults to `main`. The script fetches any `codex/*`
remote branches and merges them into the specified branch.
